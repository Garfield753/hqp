This directory is a placeholder for DASPK3. Due to license restrictions 
we can not include it anymore with the HQP/Omuses distribution.

DASPK3 can be integrated with Omuses as follows:

1)
Check out the site
http://www.engineering.ucsb.edu/~cse/software.html
and download the distribution file ddaspk30.tar.gz
into this directory.

2)
Configure Hqp/Omuses with the --enable-fortran option and compile it.
