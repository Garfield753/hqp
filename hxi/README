This directory contains Hqp eXternal Interfaces (HXI).

Currently provided is:

* Interface to Simulink(R) S-function. 

The interface provides the data structures and macros required to
compile a simple discrete-time or continuous-time S-function for
Hqp. Even though only a subset of the Simulink(R) S-function interface
is covered, this approch has the main advantage that problems with not
supported features more likely appear already at compilation time
(note that hardly all S-function features are sensible for
optimization). Furthermore exact derivatives can be obtained in this
way using ADOL-C. The main obstacles of the current interface are that
the whole S-function must be available in source form and must compile
with real_T defined as ADOL-C adouble.

See also the sfun examples in the demo collection (odc directory).
