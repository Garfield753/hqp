This dicectory contains Hqp eXternal Interfaces (HXI). 

Currently an S-function interface is provided. It emulates the data
structures and macros required to compile a simple discrete-time or
continuous-time S-function for Hqp. Even though only a subset of the
S-function interface is emulated, this approch has the main advantage
that problems with not supported features more likely appear already
at compilation time (note that hardly all S-function features are
sensible for optimization). Furthermore exact derivatives can be
obtained in this way using ADOL-C. The main drawback is that the whole
s-Function must be available in source form.

See also the sfun examples in the demo collection (odc directory).
