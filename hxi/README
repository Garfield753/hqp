This directory contains Hqp eXternal Interfaces (HXI).

Currently provided is:

* Interface to Simulink(R) S-function in two versions. 

** Calling interface to binary MEX S-function

The files Hxi_MEX_SFunction.[hC] implement a calling interface 
using dynamic load functions dlopen, dlsym, dlerror, dlclose.
The main problem with this interface is that currently no model
Jacobians are officially supported for S-functions, i.e. derivatives
have to be approximated numerically.

** Emulation of S-function interface using ADOL-C

The interface in Hxi_SimStruct.h, Hxi_mxArray.h, Hxi_sfun_types.h 
provides the data structures and macros required to compile 
a simple discrete-time or continuous-time S-function for Hqp. 
Only a subset of the Simulink(R) S-function interface is covered. 
The whole S-function must be available in source form and 
must compile with real_T defined as ADOL-C adouble.
This approch has the main advantage that problems with not
supported features more likely appear already at compilation time
(note that hardly all S-function features are sensible for
optimization). Furthermore exact derivatives can be obtained in this
way using ADOL-C.
