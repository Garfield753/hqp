HQP is a solver for nonlinearly constrained large-scale optimization
problems. It is developed with respect to problems that have a
sufficient regular sparsity structure, e.g. discrete-time optimal
control problems. The key features are:
 + implementation with algorithms and data structures for sparse matrices
 + interior point procedure for the treatment of constraints
 + Newton-type SQP procedure for the treatment of nonlinearities

HQP provides the following interfaces for problem formulation:
 + DOCP     -- discrete-time optimal control problems (own interface)
 + CUTE     -- constrained and unconstrained testing environment
 + ASCEND   -- simulation environment (experimental status)

Omuses is a front-end for HQP building on the DOCP interface. 
It supports the efficient formulation and solution of multistage problems 
(e.g. discrete-time optimal control problems). 
The key features are:
 + optimization problems are specified in the programming
   language C++
 + ADOL-C is used for the automatic calculation of exact derivatives and 
   sensitivity equations
 + numerical integration routines are provided for the treatment of 
   differential equations
 + HQP is applied to the solution of the internally formed large-scale 
   nonlinear programming problems 

Omuses provides the following interfaces to hook models to HQP:
 + OmSim     -- object-oriented modeling and simulation environment
 + S-function-- simulation blocks
