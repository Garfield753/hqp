# HQP: a solver for sparse nonlinear optimization

HQP is a numerical solver for nonlinearly constrained large-scale optimization. It is intended for optimization programs with sufficient regular sparse structure. Such programs arise e.g. from the numerical treatment of optimal control. 

External interfaces allow the formulation of optimization programs based on widely used formats, including also simulation formats.
