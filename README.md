# HQP: a solver for sparse nonlinear optimization

HQP is a solver for nonlinearly constrained large-scale optimization. It is intended for problems with sufficient regular sparsity structure. Such optimization problems arise e.g. from the numerical treatment of optimal control problems. 

External interfaces allow the formulation of optimization problems based on widely used model formats.
