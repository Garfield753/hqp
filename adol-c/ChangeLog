! started with ADOL-C version 1.9.0 !

Version 1.9.1
   20040524 kowarz: changed include of adolc files from standard notation
                    (#include <...>) to user file notation (#include "...")

   20040607 kowarz: bug fixed in tayutil.c (taylor_begin)
                    ( old taylor memory was never freed
                      => chance to run out of memory if used many times on
                         same tag -> dependend on memory size )
                    => moved "free( ... save_taylor)" ahead of
                       " ... save_taylor = 0"
                    thanks to Teijo T Arponen

   20040717 kowarz: bug fixed in tayutil.c (taylor_begin)
                    ( old temporary files were never closed
                      => could result in program crash due to too many file
                         handles -> system dependend )
                    => old files are closed now before new ones are opened
                    thanks to Andrej Ponomarenko

   20040913 kowarz: added driver jacobian_partx in drivers/drivers.c and
                    drivers/drivers.h that was written down earlier but was
                    not added to the repository
