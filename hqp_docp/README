README for hqp_docp, an example for applying HQP
directly to multistage problems

The front-end Omuses is intended to provide as much comfort as
possible when specifying multistage problems. However, the cost is
computational time. The DOCP interface, which is accessed by Omuses,
can also be used directly. Following things have to be specified 
manually: 
	-- derivatives
	-- solutions of differential equations over stages
	-- sample periods within stages

Try out hqp_docp as follows:

(1)
Invoke
  ./make
to create the executable 'docp'.

(2)
Invoke
  ./docp
to run a simple example (constrained double integrator).
