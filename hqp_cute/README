README for hqp_cute, the interface for HQP 1.5 to CUTE
Ruediger Franke, 9/13/98

HQP is a solver for nonlinearly constrained large-scale optimization
problems. It is developed with respect to problems that have a
sufficient regular sparsity structure, e.g. discrete-time optimal
control problems. Its key features are:

 + implementation with algorithms and data structures for sparse matrices
 + interior point procedure for the treatment of constraints
 + Newton-type SQP procedure for the treatment of nonlinearities

The compiled HQP library is available for several major platforms from
 ftp://olymp.systemtechnik.tu-ilmenau.de/pub/tools/omuses

This distribution contains the files needed to run HQP in the CUTE 
environment. The constrained and unconstrained testing environment CUTE 
is available from 
 ftp://joyous-gard.cc.rl.ac.uk/pub/cute.
Furthermore, you need a Tcl installation (version 8.0 or higher). See
 http://www.scriptics.com

HQP can be installed in addition to CUTE as follows:

(1) 
Four files have to be copied into an existing CUTE installation:

 $CUTEDIR +- interfaces +--------- sdhqp        (call the SIF decoder)
          |             |
          |             +--------- hqp          (compile and call a binary)
          |
          +- hqp ----------------- hqp_cute.tcl (HQP options and execution)
          |
          +- tools --- sources --- hqpma.f      (Fortran interface code)

Please check the installation script and execute it for copying the files

   ./copycute

Add the new Fortran module hqpma.o to 
 $CUTEDIR/tools/sources/makefile, line 79 (variable OB)
and compile it, e.g.

   $CUTEDIR/instll double large


(2) 
Install the HQP library in a directory known to your loader.
In the file
  $CUTEDIR/interfaces/hqp, line 51ff,
modify compiler options, libraries, and paths according to your 
installation. In particular add the C++ libraries (CCLIBS) needed by 
libhqp (e.g. if libhqp was compiled using gcc and you don't use g77, 
then add libgcc -- otherwise the symol __pure_virtual can't be resolved).


(3) 
Apply HQP as described in the documentation (doc directory).
